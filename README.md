![Screenshot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMzM3OTExLzE2NzYyNzcucG5n/original/8coXBD.png)

**A top-down game featuring Pong, Breakout and pinball mechanics.**

You land on a space station and must complete several objectives
before you can exit.

To win, push comets into goals and destroy all bricks in each level.
Escape space before time runs out, or the shuttle will leave without you!

*Created using Godot Engine and open source software (GIMP, Audacity, Fedora).*
